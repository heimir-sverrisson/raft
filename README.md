# raft
Yet another implementation of the RAFT distributed concensus algorithm.
The implementation is done in C++ and is mostly for my pleasure working on low level things that include networking, distributed systems and hard algorithms.

##Status
The following things are starting to work:

* UDP client and server sockets
* Multi-threading
